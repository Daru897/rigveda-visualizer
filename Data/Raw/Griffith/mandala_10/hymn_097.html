 <p>1. HERBS that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than the Gods,&#151;<br> Of these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred powers and seven.<br> 2 Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are your growths.<br> Do ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from disease.<br> 3 Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing fruit,<br> Plants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in the race.<br> 4 Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the Goddesses:<br> Steed, cow, and garment may I win, win back thy very self, O man.<br> 5 The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna tree:<br> Winners of cattle shali ye be if ye regain for me this man.<br> 6 He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd of men,&#151;<br> Physician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease.<br> 7 Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishments, in strengthening power,&#151;<br> All these have I provided here, that this man may be whole again.<br> 8 The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle from the stall,&#151;<br> Plants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital breath, O man.<br> 9 Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye called.<br> Rivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings disease.<br> 10 Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold.<br> The Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was there.<br> 11 When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs within my hand,<br> The spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life.<br> 12 He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by member, joint by joint,&#151;<br> From him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of strife.<br> 13 Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher.<br> Fly with the wind's impetuousspeed, vanish together with the storm.<br> 14 Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to each,<br> All of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of mine.<br> 15 Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and the blossomless,<br> Urged onward by B&#7771;haspati, release us from our pain and grief;<br> 16 Release me from the curse's plague and woe that comes from Varu&#7751;a;<br> Free me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the Gods.<br> 17 What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward, thus they spake:<br> No evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we pervade,<br> 18 Of all the many Plants whose King is, Soma, Plants of hundred forms,<br> Thou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet to the heart.<br> 19 O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o&#146;erspread the earth,<br> Urged onward by B&#7771;haspati, combine your virtue in this Plant.<br> 20 Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for whom I dig:<br> And let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours.<br> 21 All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have departed far away,<br> Come all assembled and confer your healing power upon this Herb.<br> 22 With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy and say:<br> O King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brahman undertakes.<br> 23 Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant thy vassals are the trees.<br> Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to injure us.</p>
