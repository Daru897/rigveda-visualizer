 <p>1 In the great synod will I laud thy two Bay Steeds: I prize the sweet strong drink of thee the Warrior-God,<br> His who pours lovely oil as &#146;twere with yellow drops. Let my songs enter thee whose form hath golden tints.<br> 2 Ye who in concert sing unto the goldhued place, like Bay Steeds driving onward to the heavenly seat,<br> For Indra laud ye strength allied with Tawny Steeds, laud him whom cows content as &#146;twere with yellow drops.<br> 3 His is that thunderbolt, of iron, goldenhued, gold-coloured, very dear, and yellow in his arms;<br> Bright with strong teeth, destroying with its tawny rage. In Indra are set fast all forms of golden hue.<br> 4 As if a lovely ray were laid upon the sky, the golden thunderbolt spread out as in a race.<br> That iron bolt with yellow jaw smote Ahi down. A thousand flames had he who bore the tawny-hued.<br> 5 Thou, thou, when praised by men who sacrificed of old. hadst pleasure in their lauds, O Indra golden-haired.<br> All that befits thy song of praise thou welcornest, the perfect pleasant gift, O Golden-hued from birth.<br> 6 These two dear Bays bring hither Indra on his car, Thunder-armed, joyous, meet for laud, to drink his fill.<br> Many libations flow for him who loveth them: to Indra have the gold-hued Soma juices run.<br> 7 Tle gold-hued drops have flowed to gratify his wish: the yellow dro s have urged the swift Bays to the Strong.<br> He who speeds on with Bay Steeds even as he lists hath satisfied his longing for the golden drops.<br> 8 At the swift draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the Iron One with yellow beard and yellow hair.<br> He, Lord of Tawny Coursers, Lord of fleet-foot Mares, will bear his Bay Steeds safely over all distress.<br> 9 His yellow-coloured jaws, like ladles move apart, what time, for strength, he makes the yellow-tinted stir,<br> When, while the bowl stands there, he grooms his Tawny Steeds, when he hath drunk strong drink, the sweet juice that he loves.<br> 10 Yea, to the Dear One's seat in homes of heaven and earth the Bay Steeds' Lord hath whinnied like a horse for food.<br> Then the great wish hath seized upon him mightily, and the Beloved One hath gained high power of life,<br> 11 Thou, comprehending with thy might the earth and heaven, acceptest the dear hymn for ever new and new.<br> O Asura, disclose thou and make visible the Cow's beloved home to the bright golden Sun.<br> 12 O Indra, let the eager wishes of the folk bring thee, delightful, golden-visored, on thy car,<br> That, pleased with sacrifice wherein ten fingers toil, thou mayest, at the feast, drink of our offered meath.<br> 13 Juices aforetime, Lord of Bays, thou drankest; and thine especially is this libation.<br> Gladden thee, Indra, with the meath-rich Soma: pour it down ever, Mighty One! within thee.</p>
