 <p>1. WITH this my song I strive to reach this guest of yours, who wakes at early morn, the Lord of all the tribes.<br> Each time he comes from heaven, the Pure One from of old: from ancient days the Child cats everlasting food.<br> 2 Whom, well-dis sed, the Blirgus stablished as a rriend, whom men must glorify, high-flaming in the wood.<br> As such, most friendly, thou art every day extolled in lauds by Vitahavya, O thou wondrous God.<br> 3 Be thou the foeless helper of the skilful man, subduer of the enemy near or far away.<br> Bestow a wealthy home on men, O Son of Strength. Give Vitahavya riches spreading far and wide, give Bharadv&#257;ja wide-spread wealth.<br> 4 Him, your refulgent guest, Agni who comes from heaven, the Herald of mankind, well-skilled in sacred rites,<br> Who, like a holy singer, utters heavenly words, oblation-bearer, envoy, God, I seek with hymns.<br> 5 Who with his purifying, eye-attracting form hath shone upon the earth as with the light of Dawn;<br> Who speeding on, as in the fight of Etaia, cometh, untouched by age, as one athirst in heat.<br> 6 Worship ye Agni, Agni, with your log of wood; praise your beloved, your beloved guest with songs.<br> Invite ye the Immortal hither with your hymns. A God among the Gods, he loveth what is choice, loveth our service, God mid Gods.<br> 7 Agni inflamed with fuel in my song I sing, pure, Cleanser, steadlast, set in tront at sacrifice.<br> Wise J&#257;tavedas we implore with prayers for bliss the Priest, the holy Singer, bounteous, void of guile.<br> 8 Men, Agni, in each age have made thee, Deathiess One, their envoy, offering-bearer, guard adorable.<br> With reverence Gods and mortals have established thee, the ever-watchful, omnipresent Household Lord.<br> 9 Thou, Agni, ordering the works and ways of both, as envoy of the Gods traversest both the worlds.<br> When we lay claim to thy regard and gracious fare, be thou to us a thriceprotecting friendly guard.<br> 10 Him fair of face, rapid, and fair to look on, him very wise may we who know not follow.<br> Let him who knows all rules invite for worship, Agru announce our offering to the Immortals.<br> 11 Him, Agni, thou deliverest and savest who brings him prayer to thee the Wise, O Hero,<br> The end of sacrifice or its inception; yea, thou endowest him with power and riches.<br> 12 Guard us from him who would assail us, Agni; preserve us, O thou Victor, from dishonour.<br> Here let the place of darkening come upon thee: may wealth be ours, desirable in thousands.<br> 13 Agni, the Priest, is King, Lord of the homestead, he, Jatayedas, knows all generations.<br> Most skilful worshipper mid Gods and mortals, may he begin the sacrifice, the Holy.<br> 14 Whate&#146;er to-day thou, bright-flamed Priest, enjoyest from the man's rite-for thou art sacrificer-<br> Worship, for duly dost thou spread in greatness: bear off thine ofrerings of to-day, Most Youthful.<br> 15 Look thou upon the viands duly laid for thee. Fain would he set thee here to worship Heaven and,Earth.<br> Help us, O liberal Agni, in the strife for spoil, so that we may o&#146;ercome all things that trouble us, o&#146;ercome, o&#146;ercome them with thy help.<br> 16 Together with all Gods, O fair-faced Agni, be seated first upon the woollined altar,<br> Nest-like, bedewed with oil. Bear this our worship to Savitar who sacrifices rightly.<br> 17 Here the arranging priests, as did Atharvan, rub this Agni forth,<br> Whom, not bewildered, as he moved in winding ways, they brought from gloom.<br> 18 For the Gods&#146; banquet be thou born, for full perfection and for weal.<br> Bring the Immortal Gods who strengthen holy Law: so let our sacrifice reach the Gods.<br> 19 O Agni, Lord and Master of men's homesteads, with kindled fuel we have made thee mighty.<br> Let not our household gear be found defective. Sharpen us with thy penetrating splendour.</p>
