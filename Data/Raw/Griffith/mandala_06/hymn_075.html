 <p>1. THE warrior's look is like a thunderous rain-cloud's, when, armed with mail, he seeks the lap of battle.<br> Be thou victorious with unwounded body: so let the thickness of thy mail protect thee.<br> 2 With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with Bow be victors in our hot encounters.<br> The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with the Bow may we subdue all regions.<br> 3 Close to his car, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her well-loved Friend in her embraces.<br> Strained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman-this Bowstring that preserves us in the combat.<br> 4 These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear, mother-like, their child upon their bosom.<br> May the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder, scatter, in unison, the foes who hate us.<br> 5 With many a son, father of many daughters, He clangs and clashes as he goes to battle.<br> Slung on the back, pouring his brood, the Quiver vanquishes all opposing bands and armies.<br> 6 Upstanding in the Car the skilful Charioteer guides his strong Horses on whithersoe&#146;er he will.<br> See and admire the strength of those controlling Reins which from behind declare the will of him who drives.<br> 7 Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked to the Chariots, showing forth their vigour,<br> With their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never flinching, trample and destroy them.<br> 8 Car-bearer is the name of his oblation, whercon are laid his Weapons and his Armour.<br> So let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful Car with hearts exceeding joyful.<br> 9 In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life, profound and strong in trouble,<br> Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free, real heroes, conquerors of armies.<br> 10 The Brahmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma-draughts, and, graciously inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth.<br> Guard us trom evil, P&#363;&#7779;an, guard us strengtheners of Law: let not the evil-wisher master us.<br> 11 Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with cow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.<br> There where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may the Arrows shelter and protect us.<br> 12 Avoid us thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies be as stone.<br> May Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well.<br> 13 He lays his blows upon their backs, he deals his blows upon their thighs.<br> Thou, Whip, who urgest horses, drive sagacious horses in the fray.<br> 14 It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away the friction of the bowstring:<br> So may the Brace, well-skilled in all its duties, guard manfully the man from every quarter.<br> 15 Now to the Shaft with venom smeared, tipped with deer-horn, with iron mouth,<br> Celestial, of Parjanya's seed, be this great adoration paid.<br> 16 Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou Arrow, sharpened by our prayer.<br> Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive.<br> 17 There where the flights of Arrows fall like boys whose locks are yet unshorn.<br> Even there may Brahma&#7751;aspati, and Aditi protect us well, protect us well through all our days.<br> 18 Thy vital parts I cover with thine Armour: with immortality King Soma clothe thee.<br> Varu&#7751;a give thee what is more than ample, and in thy triumph may the Gods be joyful.<br> 19 Whoso would kill us, whether he be a strange foe or one of us,</p>
