 <p>1. WITH gleaming lances, with their breasts adorned with gold, the Maruts, rushing onward, hold high power of life.<br> They hasten with swift steeds easy to be controlled. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 2 Ye, as ye wist, have gained of your own selves your power: high, O ye Mighty Ones, and wide ye shine abroad.<br> They with their strength have even measured out the sky.<br> Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 3 Strong, born together, they together have waxed great: the Heroes more and more have grown to majesty<br> Resplendent as the Sun's beams in their light are they. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 4 Maruts, your mightiness deserves to be adored, sight to be longed for like the shining of the Sun.<br> So lead us with your aid to immortality.<br> Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 5 O Maruts, from the Ocean ye uplift the rain, and fraught with vaporous moisture pour the torrents down.<br> Never, ye Wonder-Workers, are your Milch-kine dry. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 6 When to your car-poles ye have yoked your spotted deer to be your steeds, and put your golden mantles on,<br> O Maruts, ye disperse all enemies abroad. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 7 Neither the mountains nor the rivers keep you back: whither ye have resolved thither ye, Maruts, go.<br> Ye compass round about even the heaven and earth. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> Whate&#146;er is ancient, Maruts, what of recent time, whate&#146;er is spoken, Vasus, what is chanted forth,<br> They who take cognizance of all of this are ye. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 9 Be gracious unto us, ye Maruts, slay us not extend ye unto us shelter of many a sort.<br> Pay due regard unto our friendship and our praise. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.<br> 10 O Maruts, lead us on to higher fortune deliver us, when lauded, from afflictions.<br> Accept, ye Holy Ones, the gifts we bring you. May we be masters of abundant riches.</p>
