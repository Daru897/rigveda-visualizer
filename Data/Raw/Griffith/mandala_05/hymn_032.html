 <p>1&#7788;HE well thou clavest, settest free the fountains, and gavest rest to floods that were obstructed.<br> Thou, Indra, laying the great mountain open, slaying the D&#257;nava, didst loose the torrents.<br> 2 The fountain-depths obstructed in their seasons, thou, Thunderer! madest flow, the mountain's udder.<br> Strong Indra, thou by slaying e&#146;en the Dragon that lay extended there hast shown thy vigour.<br> 3 Indra with violence smote down the weapon,<br> yea, even of that wild and mighty creature.<br> Although he deemed himself alone unequalled, another had been born e&#146;en yet more potent.<br> 4 Him, whom the heavenly food of these delighted, child of the mist, strong waxing, couched in darkness,<br> Him the bolt-hurling Thunderer with his lightning smote down and slew, the D&#257;nava's wrath-fire, &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a.<br> 5 Though he might ne&#146;er be wounded still his vitals felt that, the God's bolt, which his powers supported,<br> When, after offered draughts, Strong Lord, thou laidest him, fain to battle, in the pit in darkness.<br> 6 Him as he lay there huge in length extended, still waxing in the gloom which no sun lightened,<br> Him, after loud-voiced threats, the Hero Indra, rejoicing in the poured libation, slaughtered.<br> 7 When 'gainst the mighty D&#257;nava his weapon Indra uplifted, power which none could combat,<br> When at the hurling of his bolt he smote him, he made him lower than all living creatures.<br> 8 The fierce God seized that huge and restless coiler, insatiate, drinker of the sweets, recumbent,<br> And with his mighty weapon in his dwelling smote down the footless evil-speaking ogre.<br> 9 Who may arrest his strength or cheek his vigour? Alone, resistless, he bears off all riches.<br> Even these Twain, these Goddesses, through terror of Indra's might, retire from his dominion.<br> 10 E&#146;en the Celestial Axe bows down before him, and the Earth, lover-like, gives way to Indra.<br> As he imparts all vigour to these people, straightway the folk bend them to him the Godlike.<br> 11 I hear that thou wast born sole Lord of heroes of the Five Races, famed among the people.<br> As such my wishes have most lately grasped him, invoking Indra both at eve and morning.<br> 12 So, too, I hear of thee as in due season urging to action and enriching singers.<br> What have thy friends received from thee, the Brahmans who, faithful, rest their hopes on thee, O Indra?</p>
