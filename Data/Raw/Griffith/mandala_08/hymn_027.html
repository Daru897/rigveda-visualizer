 <p>1. CHEIF Priest is Agni at the laud, as stones and grass at sacrifice:<br> With song I seek the Maruts, Brahma&#7751;aspati, Gods for help much to be desired.<br> 2 I sing to cattle and to Earth, to trees, to Dawns, to Night, to plants.<br> O all ye Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, be ye the furtherers of our thoughts.<br> 3 Forth go, with Agni, to the Gods our sacrifice of ancient use,<br> To the &#256;dityas, Varu&#7751;a whose Law stands fast, and the all-lightening Marut troop.<br> 4 Lords of all wealth, may they be strengtheners of man, destroyers of his enemies.<br> Lords of all wealth, do ye, with guards which none may harm, preserve our dwelling free from foes.<br> 5 Come to us with one mind to-day, come to us all with one accord,<br> Maruts with holy song, and, Goddess Aditi, Mighty One, to our house and home.<br> 6 Send us delightful things, ye Maruts, on your steeds: come ye, O Mitra, to our gifts.<br> Let Indra, Varu&#7751;a, and the &#256;dityas sit, swift Heroes, on our sacred grass.<br> 7 We who have trimmed the grass for you, and set the banquet in array,<br> And pressed the Soma, call you, Varuina, like men, with sacrificial fires aflame.<br> 8 O Maruts, Visinu, A&#347;vins, P&#363;&#7779;an, haste away with minds turned hitherward to Me.<br> Let the Strong Indra, famed as V&#7771;tra's slayer, come first with the winners of the spoil.<br> 9 Ye Guileless Gods, bestow on us a refuge strong on every side,<br> A sure protection, Vasus, unassailable from near at hand or from afar.<br> 10 Kinship have I with you, and close alliance O ye Gods, destroyers of our foes.<br> Call us to our prosperity of former days, and soon to new klicity.<br> 11 For now have I sent forth to you, that I may win a fair reward,<br> Lords of all wealth, with homage, this my song of praise. like a milch-cow that faileth not.<br> 12 Excellent Savitar hath mounted up on high for you, ye sure and careful Guides.<br> Bipeds and quadrupeds, with several hopes and aims, and birds have settled to their tasks.<br> 13 Singing their praise with God-like thought let us invoke each God for grace,<br> Each God to bring you help, each God to strengthen you.<br> 14 For of one spirit are the Gods with mortal man, co-sharers all of gracious gifts.<br> May they increase our strength hereafter and to-day, providing case and ample room.<br> 15 I laud you, O ye Guileless Gods, here where we meet to render praise.<br> None, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, harins the mortal, man who honours and obeys your laws.<br> 16 He makes his house endure, he gathers plenteous food who pays obedience to your will.<br> Born in his sons anew he spreads as Law commands, and prospers every way unharmed.<br> 17 E&#146;en without war he gathers wealth, and goes hisway on pleasant paths,<br> Whom Mitra, Varu&#7751;a and Aryaman protect, sharing the gift,of one accord.<br> 18 E&#146;en on the plain for him ye make a sloping path, an easy way where road is none:<br> And far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish, shot at him in vain.<br> 19 If ye appoint the rite to-day, kind Rulers, when the Sun ascends,<br> Lords of all wealth, at sunset or at wakingtime, or be it at the noon of day,<br> 20 Or, Asuras, when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to sacrifice, at eve<br> may we, O Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, come then into the midst of You.<br> 21 If ye to-day at sunrise, or at noon, or in the gloom of eve,<br> Lords of all riches, give fair treasure to the man, the wise man who hath sacrificed,<br> 22 Then we, imperial Rulers, claim of you this boon, your wide protection, as a son.<br> May we, &#256;dityas, offering holy gifts, obtain that which shall bring us greater bliss.</p>
