 <p>1. WITH what bright beauty are the Maruts jointly invested, peers in age, who dwell together?<br> From what place have they come? With what intention? Sing they their strength through love of wealth, these Heroes?<br> 2 Whose prayers have they, the Youthful Ones, accepted? Who to his sacrifice hath turned the Maruts?<br> We will delay them on their journey sweeping&#151;with what high spirit!&#151;through the air like eagles.<br> 3 Whence comest thou alone, thou who art mighty, Indra, Lord of the Brave? What is thy purpose?<br> Thou greetest us when meeting us the Bright Ones. Lord of Bay Steeds, say what thou hast against us.<br> 4 Mine are devotions, hymns; sweet are libations. Strength stirs, and hurled forth is my bolt of thunder.<br> They call for me, their lauds are longing for me. These my Bay Steeds bear me to these oblations.<br> 5 Therefore together with our strong companions, having adorned our bodies, now we harness,<br> Our spotted deer with might, for thou, O Indra, hast learnt and understood our Godlike nature.<br> 6 Where was that nature then of yours, O Maruts, that ye charged me alone to slay the Dragon?<br> For I in truth am fierce and strong and mighty. I bent away from every foeman's weapons.<br> 7 Yea, much hast thou achieved with us for comrades, with manly valour like thine own, thou Hero.<br> Much may we too achieve, O mightiest Indra, with our great power, we Maruts, when we will it.<br> 8 V&#7771;tra I slew by mine own strength, O Maruts, having waxed mighty in mine indignation.<br> I with the thunder in my hand created for man these lucid softly flowing waters.<br> 9 Nothing, O Maghavan, stands firm before thee; among the Gods not one is found thine equal.<br> None born or springing into life comes nigh thee. Do what thou hast to do, exceeding mighty?<br> 10 Mine only be transcendent power, whatever I, daring in my spirit, may accomplish.<br> For I am known as terrible, O Maruts I, Indra, am the Lord of what I ruined.<br> 11 Now, O ye Maruts, hath your praise rejoiced me, the glorious hymn which ye have made me, Heroes!<br> For me, for Indra, champion strong in battle, for me, yourselves, as lovers for a lover.<br> 12 Here, truly, they send forth their sheen to meet me, wearing their blameless glory and their vigour.<br> When I have seen you, Maruts, in gay splendour, ye have delighted me, so now delight me.<br> 13 Who here hath magnified you, O ye Maruts? speed forward, O ye lovers, to your lovers.<br> Ye Radiant Ones, assisting their devotions, of these my holy rites he ye regardful.<br> 14 To this hath M&#257;nya's wisdom brought us, so as to aid, as aids the poet him who worships.<br> Bring hither quick! On to the sage, ye Maruts! These prayers for you the singer hath recited.<br> 15 May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet, M&#257;na's son, M&#257;nd&#257;rya,<br> Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance!</p>
