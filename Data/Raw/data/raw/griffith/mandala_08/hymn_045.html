Who are renowned?<br> 5 &#346;avas&#299; answered, He who seeks thine enmity will battle like<br> A stately elephant on a hill.<br> 6 And hear, O Maghavan; to him who craves of thee thou grantest all<br> Whate&#146;er thou makest firm is firm.<br> 7 What time the Warrior Indra goes to battle, borne by noble steeds,<br> Best of all charioteers is he.<br> 8 Repel, O Thunder-armed, in all directions all attacks on us:<br> And be our own most glorious God.<br> 9 May Indra set our car in front, in foremost Place to win the spoil,<br> He whom the wicked injure not.<br> 10 Thine enmity may we escape, and, &#346;akra, for thy bounty, rich<br> In kine, may we come near to thee<br> 11 Softly approaching, Thunder-armed wealthy by hundreds, rich in steeds,<br> Unrivalled, ready with our gifts.<br> 12 For thine exalted excellence gives to thy worshippers each day<br> Hundreds and thousands of thy boons.<br> 13 Indra, we know thee breaker-down even of strong forts, winner of spoil,<br> As one who conquers wealth for us.<br> 14 Though thou art highest, Sage and Bold! let the drops cheer thee when we come<br> To thee as to a trafficker.<br> 15 Bring unto us the treasure of the opulent man who, loth to give,<br> Hath slighted thee for gain of wealth.<br> 16 Indra, these friends of ours, supplied with Soma, wait and look to thee,<br> As men with fodder to the herd.<br> 17 And thee who art not deaf, whose cars are quick to listen, for our aid,<br> We call to us from far away.<br> 18 When thou hast listened, make our call one which thou never wilt forget,<br> And be our very nearest Friend.<br> 19 When even now, when we have been in trouble, we have thought of thee,<br> O Indra, give us gifts of kine.<br> 20 O Lord of Strength, we rest on thee, as old men rest upon a staff:<br> We long to have. thee dwell with us.<br> 21 To Indra sing a song of praise, Hero of mighty valour, him<br> Whom no one challenges to war.<br> 22 Hero, the Soma being shed, I pour the juice for thee to drink:<br> Sate thee and finish thy carouse.<br> 23 Let not the fools, or those who mock beguile thee when they seek thine aid<br> Love not the enemies of prayer.<br> 24 Here let them with rich milky draught cheer thee to great munificence:<br> Drink as the wild-bull drinks the lake.<br> 25 Proclaim in our assemblies what deeds, new and ancient, far away,<br> The V&#7771;tra-slayer hath achieved.<br> 26 In battle of a thousand arms Indra drank Kadr&#363;'s Soma juice:<br> There he displayed his manly might.<br> 27 True undeniable strength he found in Yadu and in Turva&#347;a,<br> And conquered through the sacrifice.<br> 28 Him have I magnified, our Lord in, common, Guardian of your folk,<br> Discloser of great wealth in kine;<br> 29 &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, not to be restrained, who strengthened Tugra's son in lauds,<br> Indra beside the flowing juice;<br> 30 Who for Tri&#347;oka clave the hill that formed a wide receptacle,<br> So that the cows might issue forth.<br> 31 Whate&#146;er thy plan or purpose be, whate&#146;er, in transport, thou wouldst do,<br> Do it not, Indra, but be kind.<br> 32 But little hath been heard of done upon the earth by one like thee i<br> Let thine heart, Indra, turn to us.<br> 33 Thine then shall be this high renown, thine shall these lofty praises be,<br> When, Indra, thou art kind to us.<br> 34 Not for one trespass, not for two, O Hero, slay us, nor for three,<br> Nor yet for many trespasses.<br> 35 I fear one powerful like thee, the crusher-down of enemies,<br> Mighty, repelling all attacks.<br> 36 O wealthy God, ne&#146;er may I live to see my friend or son in need:<br> Hitherward let thy heart be turned.<br> 37 What friend, O people, unprovoked, hath ever said unto a friend,<br> He turns and leaves us in distress?<br> 38 Hero, insatiate enjoy this Soma juice so near to thee,<br> Even as a hunter rushing down.<br> 39 Hither I draw those Bays of thine yoked<br> by our hymn, with splendid car,<br> That thou mayst give unto the priests.<br> 40 Drive all our enemies away, smite down the foes who press around,<br> And bring the wealth for which we long:<br> 41 O Indra, that which is concealed in strong firm place precipitous:<br> Bring us the wealth for which we long<br> 42 Great riches which the world of men shall recognize as sent by thee:<br> Bring us the wealth for which we long.</p>
