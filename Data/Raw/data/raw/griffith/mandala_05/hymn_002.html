 <p>1. THE youthful Mother keeps the Boy in secret pressed to her close, nor yields him to the Father.<br> But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance before them.<br> 2 What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The Consort-Queen hath borne him.<br> The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time his Mother bare him.<br> 3 I saw him from afar gold-toothed, bright-coloured, hurling his weapons from his habitation,<br> What time I gave him Am&#7771;ta free from mixture. How can the Indraless, the hymnless harm me?<br> 4 I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd, brilliantly shining.<br> These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with age again grow youthful.<br> 5 Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was in truth no stranger?<br> Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he, observant, drive the herd to us-ward.<br> 6 Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of the people.<br> So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those who now reproach him.<br> 7 Thou from the stake didst loose e&#146;en &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epa bound for a thousand; for he prayed with fervour.<br> So, Agni, loose from us the bonds that bind us, when thou art seated here, O Priest who knowest.<br> 8 Thou hast sped from me, Agni, in thine anger: this the protector of Gods&#146; Laws hath told me.<br> Indra who knoweth bent his eye upon thee: by him instructed am I come, O Agni.<br> 9 Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his greatness makes all things apparent.<br> He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the Rak&#7779;as.<br> 10 Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen-edged weapons to destroy the demons.<br> Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands press round but cannot stay him.<br> 11 As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for thee have fashioned.<br> If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly Waters.<br> 12 May he, the strong-necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the foeman's wealth with none to check him.<br> Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings oblation.</p>
