 <p>1. SPRUNG from tall trees on windy heights, these rollers transport me as they turn upon the table.<br> Dearer to me the die that never slumbers than the deep draught of Mujavan's own Soma.<br> 2 She never vexed me nor was angry with me, but to my friends and me was ever gracious.<br> For the die's sake, whose single point is final, mine own devoted wife I alienated.<br> 3 My wife holds me aloof, her mother hates me: the wretched man finds none to give him comfort.<br> As of a costly horse grown old and feeble, I find not any profit of the gamester.<br> 4 Others caress the wife of him whose riches the die hath coveted, that rapid courser:<br> Of him speak father, mother, brothers saying, We know him not: bind him and take him with you.<br> 5 When I resolve to play with these no longer, my friends depart from me and leave me lonely.<br> When the brown dice, thrown on the board, have rattled, like a fond girl I seek the place of meeting.<br> 6 The gamester seeks the gambling-house, and wonders, his body all afire, Shall I be lucky?<br> Still do the dice extend his eager longing, staking his gains against his adversary.<br> 7 Dice, verily, are armed with goads and driving-hooks, deceiving and tormenting, causing grievous woe.<br> They give frail gifts and then destroy the man who wins, thickly anointed with the player's fairest good.<br> 8 Merrily sports their troop, the three-and-fifty, like Savitar the God whose ways are faithful.<br> They bend not even to the mighty's anger: the King himself pays homage and reveres them.<br> 9 Downward they roll, and then spring quickly upward, and, handless, force the man with hands to serve them.<br> Cast on the board, like lumps of magic charcoal, though cold themselves they burn the heart to ashes.<br> 10 The gambler's wife is left forlorn and wretched: the mother mourns the son who wanders homeless.<br> In constant fear, in debt, and seeking riches, he goes by night unto the home of others.<br> 11 Sad is the gambler when he sees a matron, another's wife, and his well-ordered dwelling.<br> He yokes the brown steeds in the early morning, and when the fire is cold sinks down an outcast.<br> 12 To the great captain of your mighty army, who hath become the host's imperial leader,<br> To him I show my ten extended fingers: I speak the truth. No wealth am I withholding.<br> 13 Play not with dice: no, cultivate thy corn-land. Enjoy the gain, and deem that wealth sufficient.<br> There are thy cattle there thy wife, O gambler. So this good Savitar himself hath told me.<br> 14 Make me your friend: show us some little mercy. Assail us not with your terrific fierceness.<br> Appeased be your malignity and anger, and let the brown dice snare some other captive.</p>
