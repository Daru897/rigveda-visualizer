 <p>1. TVASTAR prepares the bridal of his Daughter: all the world hears the tidings and assembles.<br> But Yama's Mother, Spouse of great Vivasv&#257;n, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling.<br> 2 From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasv&#257;n.<br> Saranyu brought to him the A&#347;vin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children.<br> 3 Guard of the world, whose cattle ne&#146;er are injured, may P&#363;&#7779;an bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge.<br> May he consign thee to these Fathers' keeping, and to the gracious Gods let Agni give thee.<br> 4 May &#256;yu, giver of all life, protect thee, and bear thee forward on the distant pathway.<br> Thither let Savitar the God transport thee, where dwell the pious who have passed-before thee.<br> 5 P&#363;&#7779;an knows all these realms: may he conduct us by ways that are most free from fear and danger.<br> Giver of blessings, glowing, all-heroic, may he, thewise and watchful, go before us.<br> 6 P&#363;&#7779;an was born to move on distant pathways, on the road far from earth and far from heaven.<br> To both most wonted places of assembly he travels and returns with perfect knowledge.<br> 7 The pious call Sarasvat&#299;, they worship Sarasvat&#299; while sacrifice proceedeth.<br> The pious called Sarasvat&#299; aforetime. Sarasvat&#299; send bliss to him who giveth.<br> 8 Sarasvat&#299;, who camest with the Fathers, with them rejoicing thee in our oblations,<br> Seated upon this sacred grass be joyful, and give us strengthening food that brings no sickness.<br> 9 Thou, called on as Sarasvat&#299; by Fathers who come right forward to our solemn service,<br> Give food and wealth to present sacrificers, a portion, worth a thousand, of refreshment.<br> 10 The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us:<br> For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement: I, rise up from them purified and brightened.<br> 11 Through days of earliest date the Drop descended on this place and on that which was before it.<br> I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop which still to one same place is moving.<br> 12 The Drop that falls, thy stalk which arms have shaken, which from the bosom of the press hath fallen,<br> Or from the Adhvaryu's purifying filter, I offer thee with heart and cry of Va&#7779;a&#7789;!<br> 13 That fallen Drop of thine, the stalk which from the ladle fell away,<br> This present God B&#7771;haspati shall pour it forth to make us rich.<br> 14 The plants of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this my speech;<br> And rich in milk the essence of the Waters: make me pure therewith.</p>
