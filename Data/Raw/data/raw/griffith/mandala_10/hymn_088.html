 <p>1. DEAR, ageless sacrificial drink is offered in light-discovering, heaven-pervading Agni.<br> The Gods spread forth through his Celestial Nature, that he might bear the world up and sustain it.<br> 2 The world was swallowed and concealed in darkness: Agni was born, and light became apparent.<br> The Deities, the broad earth, and the heavens, and plants, and waters gloried in his friendship.<br> 3 Inspired by Gods who claim our adoration, I now will laud Eternal Lofty Agni,<br> Him who hath spread abroad the earth with lustre, this heaven, and both the worlds, and air's mid-region.<br> 4 Earliest Priest whom all the Gods accepted, and chose him, and anointed him with butter,<br> He swiftly made all things that fly, stand, travel, all that hath motion, Agni J&#257;tavedas.<br> 5 Because thou, Agni, J&#257;tavedas, stoodest at the world's head with thy refulgent splendour,<br> We sent thee forth with hymns and songs and praises: thou filledst heaven and earth, God meet for worship.<br> 6 Head of the world is Agni in the night-time; then, as the Sun, at morn springs up and rises.<br> Then to his task goes the prompt Priest foreknowing the wondrous power of Gods who must be honoured.<br> 7 Lovely is he who, kindled in his greatness, hath shone forth, seated in the heavens, refulgent.<br> With resonant hymns all Gods who guard our bodies have offered up oblation in this Agni.<br> 8 First the Gods brought the hymnal into being; then they engendered Agni, then oblation.<br> He was their sacrifice that guards our bodies: him the heavens know, the earth, the waters know him.<br> 9 He, Agni, whom the Gods have generated, in whom they offered up all worlds and creatures,<br> He with his bright glow heated earth and heaven, urging himself right onward in his grandeur.<br> 10 Then by the laud the Gods engendered Agni in heaven, who fills both worlds through strength and vigour.<br> They made him to appear in threefold essence: he ripens plants of every form and nature.<br> 11 What time the Gods, whose due is worship, set him as S&#363;rya, Son of Aditi, in heaven,<br> When the Pair, ever wandering, sprang to being, all creatures that existed looked upon them.<br> 12 For all the world of life the Gods made Agni Vai&#347;v&#257;nara to be the days' bright Banner,&#151;<br> Him who hath spread abroad the radiant Mornings, and, coming with his light, unveils the darkness.<br> 13 The wise and holy Deities engendered Agni Vai&#347;v&#257;nara whom age ne&#146;er touches.<br> The Ancient Star that wanders on for ever, lofty and. strong, Lord of the Living Being.<br> 14 We call upon the Sage with holy verses, Agni Vai&#347;v&#257;nara the ever-beaming,<br> Who hath surpassed both heaven and earth in greatness: he is a God below, a God above us.<br> 15 I have heard mention of two several pathways, ways of the Fathers and of Gods and mortals.<br> On these two paths each moving creature travels, each thing between the Father and the Mother.<br> 16 These two united paths bear him who journeys born from the head and pondered with the spirit<br> He stands directed to all things existing, hasting, unresting in his fiery splendour.<br> 17 Which of us twain knows where they speak together, upper and lower of the two rite-leaders?<br> Our friends have helped to gather our assembly. They came to sacrifice; who will announce it?<br> 18 How many are the Fires and Suns in number? What is the number of the Dawns and Waters?<br> Not jestingly I speak to you, O Fathers. Sages, I ask you this for information.<br> 19 As great as is the fair-winged Morning's presence to him who dwells beside us, M&#257;tari&#347;van!<br> Is what the Brahman does when he approaches to sacrifice and sits below the Hotar.</p>
