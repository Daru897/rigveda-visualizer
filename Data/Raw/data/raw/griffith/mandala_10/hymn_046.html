 <p>1. STABLISHED for thee, to lend thee vital forces, Giver of wealth, Guard of his servant's body.<br> The Great Priest, born, who knows the clouds, Abider with men, is seated in the lap of waters.<br> 2 Worshipping, seeking him with adoration like some lost creature followed by its footprints,<br> Wise Bh&#7771;gus, yearning in their hearts, pursued him, and found him lurking where the floods are gathered.<br> 3 On the Cow's forehead, with laborious searching, Trita, the offspring of Vibhiavas, found him.<br> Born in our houses, Youthful, joy-bestower, he now becomes the central point of brightness.<br> 4 Yearning, with homage, they have set and made him blithe Priest among mankind, oblation-bearer,<br> Leader of rites and Purifier, envoy of men, as sacrifice that still advances.<br> 5 The foolish brought the ne&#146;er-bewildered forward, great, Victor, Song-inspirer, Fort-destroyer.<br> Leading the Youth gold-bearded, like a courser gleaming with wealth, they turned their hymn to profit.<br> 6 Holding his station firmly in the houses, Trita sat down within his home surrounded<br> Thence, as Law bids, departs the Tribes' Companion having collected men with no compulsion.<br> 7 His are the fires, eternal, purifying, that make the houses move, whose smoke is shining,<br> White, waxing in their strength, for ever stirring, and sitting in the wood; like winds are Somas.<br> 8 The tongue of Agni bears away the praisesong, and, through his care for Earth, her operations.<br> Him, bright and radiant, living men have stablished as their blithe Priest, the Chief of Sacrificers.<br> 9 That Agni, him whom Heaven and Earth engendered, the Waters. Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, and with might, the Bh&#7771;gus,<br> Him M&#257;tari&#347;van and the Gods have fashioned holy for man and first to be entreated.<br> 10 Agni, whom Gods have made oblationbearer, and much-desiring men regard as holy,<br> Give life to him who lauds thee when he worships, and then shall glorious men in troops adore thee.</p>
