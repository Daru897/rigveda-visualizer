 <p>1. FAIN would I win my friend to kindly friendship. So may the Sage, come through the air's wide ocean,<br> Remembering the earth and days to follow, obtain a son, the issue of his father.<br> 2 Thy friend loves not the friendship which considers her who is near in kindred as stranger.<br> Sons of the mighty Asura, the Heroes, supporters of the heavens, see far around them.<br> 3 Yea, this the Immortals seek of thee with longing, progeny of the sole existing mortal.<br> Then let thy soul and mine be knit together, and as a loving husband take thy consort.<br> 4 Shall we do now what we ne&#146;er did aforetime? we who spake righteously now talk impurely?<br> Gandharva in the floods, the Dame of Waters-such is our bond, such our most lofty kinship.<br> 5 Even in the womb God Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, Vivifier, shaping all forms, Creator, made us consorts.<br> None violates his holy ordinances: that we are his the heavens and earth acknowledge.<br> 6 Who knows that earliest day whereof thou speakest? Who hatb beheld it? Who can here declare it?<br> Great is the Law of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra. What, wanton! wilt thou say to men to tempt them?<br> 7 I, Yami, am possessed by love of Yama, that I may rest on the same couch beside him.<br> I as a wife would yield me to my husband. Like car-wheels let us speed to meet each other.<br> 8 They stand not still, they never close their eyelids, those sentinels of Gods who wander round us.<br> Not me-go quickly, wanton, with another, and hasten like a chariot wheel to meet him.<br> 9 May S&#363;rya's eye with days and nights endow him, and ever may his light spread out before him.<br> In heaven and earth the kindred Pair commingle. On Yam! be the unbrotherly act of Yama.<br> 10 Sure there will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters will do acts unmeet for kinsfolk.<br> Not me, O fair one,&#151;seek another husband, and make thine arm a pillow for thy consort.<br> 11 Is he a brother when no lord is left her? Is she a sister when Destruction cometh?<br> Forced by my love these many words I utter. Come near, and hold me in thy close embraces.<br> 12 I will not fold mine arms about thy body: they call it sin when one comes near his sister.<br> Not me,&#151;prepare thy pleasures with another: thy brother seeks not this from thee, O fair one.<br> 13 Alas! thou art indeed a weakling, Yama we find in thee no trace of heart or spirit.<br> As round the tree the woodbine clings, another will cling albout thee girt as with a girdle.<br> 14 Embrace another, Yami; let another, even as the woodbine rings the tree, enfold thee.<br> Win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy, and he shall form with thee a blest alliance.</p>
