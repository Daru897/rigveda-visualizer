 <p>1. WHAT Splendid One, Loud-voiced, Farstriding, dost thou, well knowing, urge us to exalt with praises?<br> What give we him? When his might dawned, he fashioned the V&#7771;tra-slaying bolt, and sent us waters.<br> 2 He goes to end his work with lightning flashes: wide is the seat his Asura glory gives him.<br> With his Companions, not without his Brother, he quells Saptatha's magic devices.<br> 3 On most auspicious path he goes to battle he toiled to win heaven's light, full fain to gain it;<br> He seized the hundred-gated castle's treasure by craft, unchecked, and slew the lustful demons.<br> 4 Fighting for kine, the prize of war, and I roaming among the berd be brings the young streams hither,<br> Where, footless, joined, without a car to bear them, with jars for steeds, they pour their flood like butter.<br> 5 Bold, unsolicited for wealth, with Rudras he came, the Blameless, having left his dwelling,<br> Came, seized the food of Vamra and his consort, and left the couple weeping and unsheltered.<br> 6 Lord of the dwelling, he subdued the demon who roared aloud, six-eyed and triple-headed.<br> T&#7771;ta, made stronger by the might he lent him, struck down the boar with shaft whose point was iron.<br> 7 He raised himself on high and shot his arrow against the guileful and oppressive foeman.<br> Strong, glorious, manliest, for us he shattered the forts of Nabus when he slew the Dasyus.<br> 8 He, like a cloud that rains upon the pasture, hath found for us the way to dwell in safety.<br> When the Hawk comes in body to the Soma, armed with his iron claws he slays the Dasyus.<br> 9 He with his potent Friends gave up the mighty, gave gusnia up to Kutsa for affliction.<br> He led the lauded Kavi, he delivered Atka as prey to him and to his heroes.<br> 10 He, with his Gods who love mankind, the Wondrous, giving like Varu&#7751;a who works with magic,<br> Was known, yet young as guardian of the seasons; and he quelled Araru, four-footed dernon.<br> 11 Through lauds of him hath Au&#347;ija &#7770;ji&#347;van burst, with the Mighty's aid, the stall of Pipru.<br> When the saint pressed the juice and shone as singer, he seized the forts and with his craft subdued them.<br> 12 So, swiftly Asura, for exaltation, hath the great Vamraka come nigh to Indra.<br> He will, when supplicated, bring him blessing: he hath brought all, food, strength, a happy dwelling.</p>
