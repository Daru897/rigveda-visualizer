 <p>1. MEN have abstained from pouring juice they count not Indra as a God.<br> Where at the votary's store my friend Vrsakapi hath drunk his fill. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 2 Thou, Indra, heedless passest by the ill Vrsakapi hath wrought;<br> Yet nowhere else thou findest place wherein to drink the Soma juice. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 3 What hath he done to injure thee, this tawny beast Vrsakapi,<br> With whom thou art so angry now? What is the votary's foodful store? Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 4 Soon may the hound who hunts the boar seize him and bite him in the car,<br> O Indra, that Vrsakapi whom thou protectest as a friend, Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 5 Kapi hath marred the beauteous things, all deftly wrought, that were my joy.<br> In pieces will I rend his head; the sinner's portion sball be woo. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 6 No Dame hath ampler charms than 1, or greater wealth of love's delights.<br> None with more ardour offers all her beauty to her lord's embrace. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 7 Mother whose love is quickly wibn, I say what verily will be.<br> My,breast, O Mother, and my head and both my hips seem quivering. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 8 Dame with the lovely hands and arms, with broad hair-plaits add ample hips,<br> Why, O thou Hero's wife, art thou angry with our Vrsakapi? Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 9 This noxious creature looks on me as one bereft of hero's love,<br> Yet Heroes for my sons have I, the Maruts&#146; Friend and Indra's Queen. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 10 From olden time the matron goes to feast and general sacrifice.<br> Mother of Heroes, Indra's Queen, the rite's ordainer is extolled. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 11 So have I heard Indr&#257;&#7751;&#299; called most fortunate among these Dames,<br> For never shall her Consort die in future time through length of days. Supreme is Indra overall.<br> 12 Never, Indralni, have I joyed without my friend Vrsakapi,<br> Whose welcome offering here, made pure with water, goeth to the Gods. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 13 Wealthy Vrsakapayi, blest with sons and consorts of thy sons,<br> Indra will eat thy bulls, thy dear oblation that effecteth much. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 14 Fifteen in number, then, for me a score of bullocks they prepare,<br> And I devour the fat thereof: they fill my belly full with food. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 15 Like as a bull with pointed horn, loud bellowing amid the herds,<br> Sweet to thine heart, O Indra, is the brew which she who tends thee pours. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 18 O Indra this Vrsakapi hath found a slain wild animal,<br> Dresser, and new-made pan, and knife, and wagon with a load of wood. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 19 Distinguishing the D&#257;sa and the &#256;rya, viewing all, I go.<br> I look upon the wise, and drink the simple votary's Soma juice. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 20 The desert plains and steep descents, how many leagues in length they spread!<br> Go to the nearest houses, go unto thine home, Vrsakapi. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 21 Turn thee again Vrsakapi: we twain will bring thee happiness.<br> Thou goest homeward on thy way along this path which leads to sleep. Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 22 When, Indra and Vrsakapi, ye travelled upward to your home,<br> Where was that noisome beast, to whom went it, the beast that troubles man? Supreme is Indra over all.<br> 23 Daughter of Manu, Parsu bare a score of children at a birth.<br> Her portion verily was bliss although her burthen caused her grief.</p>
