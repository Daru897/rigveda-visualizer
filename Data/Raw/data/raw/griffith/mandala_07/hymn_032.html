 <p>1. LET none, no, not thy worshippers, delay thee far away from us.<br> Even from far away come thou unto our feast, or listen if already here.<br> 2 For here, like flies on honey, these who pray to thee sit by the juice that they have poured.<br> Wealth-craving singers have on Indra set their hope, as men set foot upon a car.<br> 3 Longing for wealth I call on him, the Thunderer with the strong right hand,<br> As a son calleth on his sire.<br> 4 These Soma juices, mixed with curd, have been expressed for Indra here.<br> Come with thy Bay Steeds, Thunder-wielder, to our home, to drink them till they make thee glad.<br> 5 May he whose ear is open hear us. He is asked for wealth: will he despise our prayer?<br> Him who bestows at once a hundred thousand gifts none shall restrain when he would give.<br> 6 The hero never checked by men hath gained his strength through Indra, he<br> Who presses out and pours his deep libations forth, O V&#7771;tra-slayer, unto thee.<br> 7 When thou dost drive the fighting men together be, thou Mighty One, the mighty's shield.<br> May we divide the wealth of him whom thou hast slain: bring us, Unreachable, his goods.<br> 8 For Indra, Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, press the Soma juice.<br> Make ready your dressed meats: cause him to favour us. The Giver blesses him who gives.<br> 9 Grudge not, ye Soma pourers; stir you, pay the rites, for wealth, to the great Conqueror.<br> Only the active conquers dwells in peace, and thrives: not for the niggard are the Gods.<br> 10 No one hath overturned or stayed the car of him who freely gives.<br> The man whom Indra and the Marut host defend comes to a stable full of kine.<br> 11 Indra, that man when fighting shall obtain the spoil, whose strong defender thou wilt be.<br> Be thou the gracious helper, Hero I of our cars, be thou the helper of our men.<br> 12 His portion is exceeding great like a victorious soldier's spoil.<br> Him who is Indra, Lord of Bays, no foes subdue. He gives the Soma-pourer strength.<br> 13 Make for the Holy Gods a hymn that is not mean, but well-arranged and fair of form.<br> Even many snares and bonds subdue not him who dwells with Indra through his sacrifice.<br> 14 Indra, what mortal will attack the man who hath his wealth in thee?<br> The strong will win the spoil on the decisive day through faith in thee, O Maghavan.<br> 15 In battles with the foe urge on our mighty ones who give the treasures dear to thee,<br> And may we with our princes, Lord of Tawny Steeds! pass through all peril, led by thee.<br> 16 Thine, Indra, is the lowest wealth, thou cherishest the mid-most wealth,<br> Thou ever rulest all the highest: in the fray for cattle none resisteth thee.<br> 17 Thou art renowned as giving wealth to every one in all the battles that are fought.<br> Craving protection, all these people of the earth, O Much-invoked, implore thy name.<br> 18 If I, O Indra, were the Lord of riches ample as thine own,<br> I should support the singer, God. who givest wealth! and not abandon him to woe.<br> 19 Each day would I enrich the man who sang my praise, in whatsoever place he were.<br> No kinship is there better, Maghavan, than thine: a father even is no more.<br> 20 With Plenty for his true ally the active man will gain the spoil.<br> Your Indra, Much-invoked, I bend with song, as bends a wright his wheel of solid wood.<br> 21 A moral wins no riches by unworthy praise: wealth comes not to the niggard churl.<br> Light is the task to give, O Maghavan, to one like me on the decisive day.<br> 22 Like kine unmilked we call aloud, Hero, to thee, and sing thy praise,<br> Looker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord, Indra, of what moveth not.<br> 23 None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath been or ever will be born.<br> Desiring horses, Indra Maghavan! and kine, as men of might we call on thee.<br> 24 Bring, Indra, the Victorious Ones; bring, elder thou, the younger host.<br> For, Maghavan, thou art rich in treasures from of old, and must be called in every fight.<br> 25 Drive thou away our enemies, O Maghavan: make riches easy to be won.<br> Be thou our good Protector in the strife for spoil: Cherisher of our friends be thou.<br> 26 O Indra, give us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons.<br> Guide us, O Much-invoked, in this our way may we still live and look upon the light.<br> 27 Grant that no mighty foes, unknown, malevolent, unhallowed, tread us to the ground.<br> With thine assistance, Hero, may we ass through all the waters that are rul`ng down.</p>
