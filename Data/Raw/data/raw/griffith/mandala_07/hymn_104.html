 <p>1. INDRA and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe, send downward, O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom.<br> Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from us, pierce the voracious ones.<br> 2 Indra and Soma, let sin round the wicked boil like as a caldron set amid the flames of fire.<br> Against the foe of prayer, devourer of raw flesh, the vile fiend fierce of eye, keep ye perpetual hate.<br> 3 Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into darkness that hath no support,<br> So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful might prevail and conquer them.<br> 4 Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth.<br> Yea, forge out of the mountains your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race.<br> 5 Indra and Soma, cast ye downward out of heaven your deadly darts of stone burning with fiery flame,<br> Eternal, scorching darts; plunge the voracious ones within the depth, and let them sink without a sound.<br> 6 Indra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the girth encompasses two vigorous steeds-<br> The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you: do ye, as Lords of men, animate these my prayers.<br> 7 In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy these evil beings, slay the treacherous fiends.<br> Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss who evermore assails us with malignity.<br> 8 Whoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my way with guileless spirit,<br> May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra, like water which the hollowed hand compresses.<br> 9 Those who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their evil natures barm the righteous,<br> May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of Nirrti consign them.<br> 10 The fiend, O Agni, who designs to injure the essence of our food, kine, steeds, or bodies,<br> May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction, both himself and offipring.<br> 11 May he be swept away, himself and children: may all the three earths press him down beneath them.<br> May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or night would fain destroy us.<br> 12 The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other.<br> Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing.<br> 13 Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title.<br> He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entangled in the noose of Indra.<br> 14 As if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts about the Gods, O Agni.<br> Why art thou angry with us, J&#257;tavedas? Destruction fall on those who lie against thee!<br> 15 So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life or if I be a demon.<br> Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath called me Y&#257;tudh&#257;na.<br> 16 May Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of all creatures perish,<br> The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid of demon nature.<br> 17 She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her guile and malice,<br> May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud ring destroy the demons.<br> 18 Spread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and grind the R&#257;k&#7779;asas to pieces,<br> Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, or sully and pollute our holy worship.<br> 19 Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it, Maghavan, made keen by Soma.<br> Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with thy rocky weapon.<br> 20 They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm indomitable Indra.<br> &#346;akra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now, let him cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.<br> 21 Indra hath ever been the fiends&#146; destroyer who spoil oblations of the Gods&#146; invokers:<br> Yea, &#346;akra, like an axe that <A HREF="errata.htm#19">splits</A> the timber, attacks and smashes them like earthen vessels.<br> 22 Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in the form of dog or cuckoo.<br> Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon.<br> 23 Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn drive off the couples of Kim&#299;dins.<br> Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble: from grief that comes from heaven mid-air preserve us.<br> 24 Slay the male demon, Indra! slay the female, joying and triumphing in arts of magic.<br> Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no more the Sun when he arises.<br> 25 Look each one hither, look around Indra and Soma, watch ye well.</p>
