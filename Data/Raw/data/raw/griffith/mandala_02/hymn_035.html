 <p>1. EAGER for spoil my flow of speech I utter: may the Floods' Child accept my songs with favour.<br> Will not the rapid Son of Waters make them lovely, for he it is who shall enjoy them?<br> 2 To him let us address the song well-fashioned, forth from the heart. Shall he not understand it'<br> The friendly Son of Waters by the greatness of Godhead hath produced all things existing.<br> 3 Some floods unite themselves and others join them: die sounding rivers fill one common storehouse.<br> On every side the bright Floods have encompassed the bright resplendent Offspring of the Waters.<br> 4 The never-sullen waters, youthful Maidens, carefully decking, wait on him the youthful.<br> He with bright rays shines forth in splendid beauty, unfed with wood, in waters, oil-enveloped.<br> 5 To him three Dames are offering food to feed him, Goddesses to the God whom none may injure.<br> Within the waters hath he pressed, as hollows, and drinks their milk who now are first made mothers.<br> 6 Here was the horse's birth; his was the sunlight. Save thou our princes from the oppressor's onslaught.<br> Him, indestructible, dwelling at a distance in forts unwrought lies and ill spirits reach not.<br> 7 He, in whose mansion is the teeming Milch-cow, swells the Gods&#146; nectar and cats noble viands.<br> The Son of Waters, gathering strength in waters, shines for his worshipper to give him treasures.<br> 8 He who in waters with his own pure Godhead shines widely, law-abiding, everlasting&#151;<br> The other worlds are verily his branches, and plants are born of him with all their offspring.<br> 9 The Waters&#146; Son hath risen, and clothed in lightning ascended up unto the curled cloud's bosom;<br> And bearing with them his supremest glory the Youthful Ones, gold-coloured, move around him.<br> 10 Golden in form is he, like gold to look on, his colour is like gold, the Son of Waters.<br> When he is seated fresh from golden birthplace those who present their gold give food to feed him.<br> 11 This the fair name and this the lovely aspect of him the Waters&#146; Son increase in secret.<br> Whom here the youthful Maids together kindle, his food is sacred oil of golden colour.<br> 12 Him, nearest Friend of many, will we worship with sacrifice. and reverence and oblation.<br> I make his back to shine, with chips provide him; I offer food and with my songs exalt him.<br> 13 The Bull hath laid his own life-germ Within them. He sucks them as an infant, and they kiss him.<br> He, Son of Waters, of unfading colour, hath entered here as in another's body.<br> 14 While here he dwelleth in sublimest station, resplendent with the rays that never perish,<br> The Waters, bearing oil to feed their offspring, flow, Youthful Ones, in wanderings about him.<br> 15 Agni, I gave good shelter to the people, and to the princes goodly preparation.<br> Blessed is all that Gods regard with favour. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
