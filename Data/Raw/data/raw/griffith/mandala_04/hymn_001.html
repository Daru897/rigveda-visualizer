 <p>1, THEE Agni, have the Gods, ever of one accord, sent hither down, a God, appointed messenger, yea, with their wisdom sent thee down.<br> The Immortal, O thou Holy One, mid mortal men, the God-devoted God, the wise, have they brought forth, brought forth the omnipresent God-devoted Sage.<br> 2 As such, O Agni, bring with favour to the Gods thy Brother Varu&#7751;a who loveth sacrifice,<br> True to the Law, the &#256;ditya who supporteth men, the King, supporter of mankind.<br> 3 Do thou, O Friend, turn hither him who is our Friend, swift as a wheel, like two car-steeds in rapid course, Wondrous! to us in rapid course.<br> O Agni, find thou grace for us with Varu&#7751;a, with Maruts who illumine all.<br> Bless us, thou Radiant One, for seed and progeny, yea, bless us, O thou Wondrous God.<br> 4 Do thou who knowest Varu&#7751;a, O Agni, put far away from us the God's displeasure.<br> Best Sacrificer, brightest One, refulgent remove thou far from us all those who hate us.<br> 5 Be thou, O Agni, nearest us with succour, our closest Friend while now this Morn is breaking.<br> Reconcile to us Varu&#7751;a, be bounteous enjoy the gracious juice; be swift to hear us.<br> 6 Excellent is the glance, of brightest splendour, which the auspicious God bestows on mortals-<br> The God's glance, longed-for even as the butter, pure, heated, of the cow, the milch-cow's bounty.<br> 7 Three are those births, the true, the most exalted, eagerly longed-for, of the God, of Agni.<br> He came invested in the boundless region, pure, radiant, friendly, mightily resplendent.<br> 8 This envoy joyeth in all seats of worship, borne on his golden car, sweet-tongued Invoker:<br> Lovely to look on, with red steeds, effulgent, like a feast rich in food, joyous for ever.<br> 9 Allied by worship, let him give man knowledge: by an extended cord they lead him onward.<br> He stays, effectual in this mortal's dwelling, and the God wins a share in his possessions.<br> 10 Let Agni -for he knows the way- conduct us to all that he enjoys of God-sent riches,<br> What all the Immortals have prepared with wisdom, Dyaus, Sire, Begetter, raining down true blessings.<br> 11 In houses first he sprang into existence, at great heaven's base, and in this region's bosom;<br> Footless and headless, both his ends concealing, in his Bull's lair drawing himself together.<br> 12 Wondrously first he rose aloft, defiant, in the Bull's lair, the homeof holy Order,<br> Longed-for, young, beautiful, and far-resplendent: and sevendear frieuds sprang up unto the Mighty.<br> 13 Here did our human fathers take their places, fain to fulfil the sacred Law of worship.<br> Forth drave they, with loud call, Dawn's teeming Milch-kine bid in the mountainstable, in the cavern.<br> 14 Splendid were they when they had rent the mountain: others, around, shall tell forth this their exploit.<br> They sang their song, prepared to free the cattle: they found the light; with holy hymns they worshipped.<br> 15 Eager, with thought intent upon the booty, the men with their celestial speech threw open,<br> The solid mountain firm, compact, enclosing, confining Cows, the stable full of cattle.<br> 16 The Milch-cow's earliest name they comprehended: they found the Mother's thrice-seven noblest titles.<br> This the bands knew, and sent forth acclamation:with the Bull's sheen the Red One was apparent.<br> 17 The turbid darkness fled, the heaven was sp, endid! up rose the bright beam of celestial Morning.<br> S&#363;rya ascended to the wide expanses, beholding deeds of men both good and evil.<br> 18 Then, afterwards they looked around, awakened, when first they held that Heaven allotted treasure.<br> Now all the Gods abide in all their dwellings. Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, be the prayer effective.<br> 19 I will call hither brightly-beaming Agni, the Herald, all-supporting, best at worship.<br> He hath disclosed, like the milch cows' pure udder, the Sorria's juice when cleansed and poured from beakers.<br> 20 The freest God of all who should be worshipped, the guest who is received in all men's houses,<br> Agni who hath secured the Gods&#146; high favour,&#151;may he be gracious, to us J&#257;tavedas.</p>
