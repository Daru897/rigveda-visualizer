 <p>1. THOU, Agni, who wilt have the strong, hast made me the Soma's priest, to worship in assembly.<br> Thou shinest to the Gods, I set the press-stones. I toil; be joyful in thyself, O Agni.<br> 2 East have we turned the rite; may the hymn aid it. With wood and worship shall they honour Agni.<br> From heaven the synods of the wise have learnt it: e&#146;en for the quick and strong they seek advancement.<br> 3 The Prudent, he whose will is pure, brought welfare, allied by birth to Heaven and Earth in kinship.<br> The Gods discovered in the midst of waters beautiful Agni with the Sisters' labour.<br> 4 Him, Blessed One, the Seven strong Floods augmented, him white at birth and red when waxen mighty.<br> As mother mares run to their new-born you ling, so at his birth the Gods wondered at Agni.<br> 5 Spreading with radiant limbs throughout the region, purging his power with wise purifications,<br> Robing himself in light, the life of waters, he spreads abroad his high and perfect glories.<br> 6 He sought heaven's Mighty Ones, the unconsuming, the unimpaired, not clothed and yet not naked.<br> Then they, ancient and young, who dwell together, Seven sounding Rivers, as one germ received him.<br> 7 His piles, assuming every form, are scattered where flow sweet waters, at the spring of fatness;<br> There stood the milch-kine with full-laden udders, and both paired Mighty Mothers of the Wondrous.<br> 8 Carefully cherished, Son of Strength, thou shoncst assuming lasting and refulgent beauties.<br> Full streams of fatness and sweet juice descended, there where the Mighty One grew strong by wisdom.<br> 9 From birth he knew even his Father's bosom, he set his voices and his streams in motion;<br> Knew him who moved with blessed Friends in secret, with the young Dames of heaven. He stayed not hidden.<br> 10 He nursed the Infant of the Sire and Maker: alone the Babe sucked many a teeming bosom.<br> Guard, for the Bright and Strong, the fellow-spouses friendly to men and bound to him in kinship.<br> 11 The Mighty One increased in space unbounded; full many a glorious flood gave strength to Agni.<br> Friend of the house, within the lap of Order lay Agni, in the Sister Rivers' service.<br> 12 As keen supporter where great waters gather, light-shedder whom the brood rejoice to look on;<br> He who begat, and will beget, the dawnlights, most manly, Child of Floods, is youthful Agni.<br> 13 Him, varied in his form, the lovely Infant of floods and plants the blessed wood hath gendered.<br> Gods even, moved in spirit, came around him, and served him at his birth, the Strong, the Wondrous.<br> 14 Like brilliant lightnings, mighty luminaries accompany the light-diffusing Agni,<br> Waxen, as &#146;twere in secret, in his dwelling, while in the boundless stall they milk out Am&#7771;ta.<br> 15 I sacrificing serve thee with oblations and crave with longing thy good-will and friendship.<br> Grant, with the Gods, thy grace to him who lauds thee, protect us with thy rays that guard the homestead.<br> 16 May we, O Agni, thou who leadest wisely, thy followers and masters of all treasures,<br> Strong in the glory of our noble offspring, subdue the godless when they seek the battle.<br> 17 Ensign of Gods hast thou become, O Agni, joy-giver, knower of all secret wisdom.<br> Friend of the homestead, thou hast lightened mortals: carborne thou goest to the Gods, fulfilling.<br> 18 Within the house hath sate the King immortal of mortals, filling full their sacred synods.<br> Bedewed with holy oil he shineth widely, Agni, the knower of all secret wisdom.<br> 19 Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, come speeding, Mighty, with thy mighty succours.<br> Grant us abundant wealth that saves from danger, that brings a good repute, a glorious portion.<br> 20 To thee who art of old these songs, O Agni, have I declared, the ancient and the later.<br> These great libations to the Strong are offiered: in every birth is J&#257;tavedas stablished.<br> 21 Stablished in every birth is J&#257;tavedas, kindled perpetual by the Vi&#347;v&#257;mitras.<br> May we rest ever in the loving-kindness, in the auspicious grace of him the Holy.<br> 22 This sacrifice of ours do thou, O Mighty, O truly Wise, bear to the Gods rejoicing.<br> Grant us abundant food, thou priestly Herald, vouchsafe to give us ample wealth, O Agni.<br> 23 As holy food, Agni, to thine'invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us he born a son, and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.</p>
