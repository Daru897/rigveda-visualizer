 <p>1. WISE, teaching, following the thought of Order, the sonless gained a grandson from his daughter.<br> Fain, as a sire, to see his child prolific, he sped to meet her with an eager spirit.<br> 2 The Son left not his portion to the brother, he made a home to hold him who should gain, it.<br> What time his Parents gave the Priest his being, of the good pair one acted, one promoted.<br> 3 Agni was born trembling with tongue that flickered, so that the Red's great children should be honoured.<br> Great is their germ, that born of them is mighty, great the Bays' Lord's approach through sacrifices.<br> 4 Conquering bands upon the Warrior waited: they recognized great light from out the darkness.<br> The conscious Dawns went forth to meet his coming, and the sole Master of the kine was Indra.<br> 5 The sages freed them from their firmbuilt prison: the seven priests drove them forward with their spirit.<br> All holy Order's pathway they discovered he, full of knowledge, shared these deeds through worship.<br> 6 When Saram&#257; had found the mountain's fissure, that vast and ancient place she plundered thoroughly.<br> In the floods' van she led them forth, light-footed: she who well knew came first unto their lowing.<br> 7 Longing for friendship came the noblest singer: the hill poured forth its treasure for the pious.<br> The Hero with young followers fought and conquered, and straightway A&#7749;giras was singing praises,<br> 8 Peer of each noble thing, yea, all excelling, all creatures doth he know, he slayeth &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a.<br> Our leader, fain for war, singing from heaven, as Friend he saved his lovers from dishonour.<br> 9 They sate them down with spirit fain for booty, making with hymns a way to life eternal.<br> And this is still their place of frequent session, whereby they sought to gain the months through Order.<br> 10 Drawing the milk of ancient seed prolific, they joyed as they beheld their own possession.<br> Their shout of triumph heated earth and heaven. When the kine showed, they bade the heroes rouse them.<br> 11 Indra drove forth the kine, that V&#7771;tra-slayer, while hymns of praise rose up and gifts were offered.<br> For him the Cow, noble and far-extending, poured pleasant juices, bringing oil and sweetness.<br> 12 They made a mansion for their Father, deftly provided him a great and glorious dwelling;<br> With firm support parted and stayed the Parents, and, sitting, fixed him there erected, mighty.<br> 13 What time the ample chalice had impelled him, swift waxing, vast, to pierce the earth and heaven,&#151;<br> Him in whom blameless songs are all united: all powers invincible belong to Indra.<br> 14 I crave thy powers, I crave thy mighty friendship: full many a team goes to the V&#7771;tra-slayer.<br> Great is the laud, we seek the Princes' favour. Be thou, O Maghavan, our guard and keeper.<br> 15 He, having found great, splendid, rich dominion, sent life and motion to his friends and lovers.<br> Indra who shone together with the Heroes begot the song, the fire, and Sun and Morning.<br> 16 Vast, the House-Friend, he set the waters flowing, all-lucid, widely spread, that move together.<br> By the wise cleansings of the meath made holy, through days, and nights they speed the swift streams onward.<br> 17 To thee proceed the dark, the treasure-holders, both of them sanctified by S&#363;rya's bounty.<br> The while thy ovely storming Friends, O Indra, fail to attain the measure of thy greatness.<br> 18 Be Lord of joyous songs, O V&#7771;tra-slayer, Bull dear to all, who gives the power of living.<br> Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, hastening, Mighty One, with mighty succours.<br> 19 Like A&#7749;giras I honour him with worship, and renovate old song for him the Ancient.<br> Chase thou the many godless evil creatures, and give us, Maghavan, heaven's light to help m.<br> 20 Far forth are spread the purifying waters convey thou us across them unto safety.<br> Save us, our Charioteer, from harm, O Indra, soon, very soon, make us win spoil of cattle.<br> 21 His kine their Lord hath shown, e&#146;en V&#7771;tra's slayer, through the black hosts he passed with red attendants.<br> Teaching us pleasant things by holy Order, to, us hath he thrown open all his portals.<br> 22 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered.<br> The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
