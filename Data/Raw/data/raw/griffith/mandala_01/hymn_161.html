 <p>1 WHY hath the Best, why hath the Youngest come to us? Upon what embassy comes he? What have we said?<br> We have not blamed the chalice of illustrious birth. We, Brother Agni, praised the goodness of the wood.<br> 2 The chalice that is single make ye into four: thus have the Gods commanded; therefore am I come.<br> If, O Sudhanvan's Children, ye will do this thing ye shall participate in sacrifice with Gods.<br> 3 What to the envoy Agni in reply ye spake, A courser must be made, a chariot fashioned here,<br> A cow must be created, and the Twain made young. When we have done these things, Brother, we turn to you.<br> 4 When thus, O &#7770;bhus, ye had done ye questioned thus, Whither went he who came to us a messenger?<br> Then Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, when he viewed the four wrought chalices, concealed himself among the Consorts of the Gods.<br> 5 As Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar thus had spoken, Let us slay these men who have reviled the chalice, drinking-cup of Gods,<br> They gave themselves new names when Soma juice was shed, and under these new names the Maiden welcomed them.<br> 6 Indra hath yoked his Bays, the A&#347;vins' car is horsed, B&#7771;haspati hath brought the Cow of every hue.<br> Ye went as &#7770;bhus, Vibhvan, V&#257;ja to the Gods, and skilled in war, obtained your share in sacrifice.<br> 7 Ye by your wisdom brought a cow from out a hide; unto that ancient Pair ye gave again their youth.<br> Out of a horse, Sudhanvan's Sons, ye formed a horse: a chariot ye equipped, and went unto the Gods.<br> 8 Drink ye this water, were the words ye spake to them; or drink ye this, the rinsing of the Mu&ntilde;ja-grass.<br> If ye approve not even this, Sudhanvan's Sons, then at the third libation gladden ye yourselves.<br> 9 Most excellent are waters, thus said one of you; most excellent is Agni, thus another said.<br> Another praised to many a one the lightning cloud. Then did ye shape the cups, speaking the words of truth.<br> 10 One downward to the water drives the crippled cow, another trims the flesh brought on the carving-board.<br> One carries off the refuse at the set of sun. How did the Parents aid their children in their task!<br> 11 On the high places ye have made the grass for man, and water in the valleys, by your skill, O Men.<br> &#7770;bhus, ye iterate not to-day that act of yours, your sleeping in the house of him whom naught can hide.<br> 12 As, compassing them round, ye glided through the worlds, where had the venerable Parents their abode?<br> Ye laid a curse on him who raised his arm at you: to him who spake aloud to you ye spake again.<br> 13 When ye had slept your fill, ye &#7770;bhus, thus ye asked, O thou whom naught may hide, who now hath wakened us?<br> The goat declared the hound to be your wakener. That day, in a full year, ye first unclosed our eyes.<br> 14 The Maruts move in heaven, on earth this Agni; through the mid-firmament the Wind approaches.<br> Varu&#7751;a comes in the sea's gathered waters, O Sons of Strength, desirous of your presence.</p>
